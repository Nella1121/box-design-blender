# box-design-blender
3D renders of the box hardware, created using “blender” with exports for solid works.
Each Box includes the following from bottom to top:

1- **Base:** It is responsible to hold the other elements together, as well as transfer power from plug to the hub

2- **Grid:** It is responsible for connecting the hub tower and other towers together. It is made a replace-able element to allow users to upgrade their hub without needing to change the towers and base, in case faster USB standards or ports are introduced in future.

3- **Hub:** It is the middle tower located in the front of Box and responsible to connect other towers together and provide input and output interface ports.

4- **Towers:** Each Box consists of up to 9 towers (including the Hub tower) and users can customize the Box with the towers they need. They can use storage towers, CPU towers or even GPU towers according to their needs.
