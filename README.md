# box-design-blender
3D renders of the box hardware, created in blender with exports for solid works.
Each Box includes the following from bottom to top:
1- Base: It is reponsible to hold the other elements together, as well as transfer power from plug to the hub
2- Grid: It is responsible to connect hub and other towers together. It is made a replace-able element to allow users upgrade their hub without needing to change the towers and base, in case faster USB standards or ports are introduced in future.
3- Hub: It is the tower located in th middle front of Box and responsible to connect other towers together and provide input and output interface ports.
4- Towers: Each Box consists of up to 9 towers (inclluding the Hub tower) and user can customize the Box with the towers they need. They can use storage towers, CPU towers or even GPU towers according to their needs.
